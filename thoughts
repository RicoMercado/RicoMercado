Simplicity and Clarity: This code shows a simple and clear way to use functions in Python. The get_sum function is straightforward, making it easy to understand and use. This is in line with good coding practices, which stress the importance of keeping functions clear and simple.
User Interaction: The code uses input() to interact with the user and collect data. This method works well for small scripts that need user input.
Modern Practices: The code uses f-strings for formatting output, which is a modern and preferred method in Python. F-strings are easier to read and more efficient than older formatting techniques.
