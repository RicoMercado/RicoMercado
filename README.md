# Introduction
This repository has Python code and examples that show how to use functions and handle data. It's divided into different folders, each focusing on various aspects like function use, data processing, and age calculations. Youâ€™ll find code samples that include both examples I was inspired by and my own versions, along with comments explaining what I learned and important points.
# Sections
# File: inspired_codes
Folder: returningdataandfunctions.py
The folder demonstrates a basic function for summing two numbers.
Folder: signatures.py
The folder shows a function that prints the age 10 years ago.
# File: my_code
Folder: returningdataandfunctions.py
The updated version of the function to sum two numbers demonstrates improvements in code style and functionality.
Folder: signatures.py
The updated version improves the age display function by allowing for dynamic input of the number of years ago.
# File: questions_clarity
The folder is dedicated to questions and clarifications related to the code and assignment.
# Key Takeaways
